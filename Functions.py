"""Similarly
str.capitalize()            Capitalizes first character. Works only one time. Doesn't change the orignal string.
str.replace("old","new")    Replaces the desired characters in the string. Eg: P--J
str.find(" ")               Returns the first index of the first occurance of character in a string.
str.count("")               Counts the occurance of a particular character in a string.
Generally negative indices don't exist rather than in the concept of negative slicing. So -1 is an invalid index.
